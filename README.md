# MNIST Digit Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of  hand-written digit . The goal is to predict the correct digit label (0-9) based on pixel values.
